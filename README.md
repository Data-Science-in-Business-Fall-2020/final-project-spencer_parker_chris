# Final_Project

The final project will consist of two groups with the below prompts. 


Group 1

How often can we expect the sharks to take food,  target, drop food, or fast. Can we predict any of these behaviors or know what the drivers are on an individual or group level? Specifically, what effect does guest presence, light training, water temperature, and time of year have on these factors? Are there any correlations between food types and location with guest presence, light training, and time of year? 

Group 2  

How does different food, group feeding, and location affect how often the sharks take food, target, drop food, or fast? Is there a pattern we can see on the individual or group level? Is there an optimal mix of food that gives us the best response? Are there any correlations between food types and location with light training, water temperature, or time of year? 

The client and the other members of the group will give recommendations to your overall score.

Each group will:
- Turn in a detailed write up of their project due on the last day of class (December 10th) 
- Give a final presentation to the client on the last day of class (December 10th)
